This is the second project that I had to do during my front-end development internship at <a href="https://www.yektanet.com">Yektanet.</a><br>
This is a to do list that has options like:
<ul>
  <li> You can set a priority to your to do cards. ( high - medium - low )</li>
  <li> Your to do list is sorted by default due to the priority of cards. </li>
  <li> Your to do cards can have colors. ( yellow - green - red )</li>
  <li> You can pin and unpin your to do cards.</li>
  <li> You can delete your to do cards.</li>
  <li> If you mark a card as done,  it will go to the bottom of the to do list.</li>
  <li> You can filter your cards according to their color.</li>
</ul>
The purpose of this project was for my skills to be improved at JavaScript and for me to code cleaner and more logical using reactivity.<br>
